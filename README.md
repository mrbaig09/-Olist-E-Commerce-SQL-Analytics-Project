# 🛒 Olist E-Commerce SQL Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs end-to-end SQL analysis on the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** — one of the most popular real-world datasets for data analytics. The goal is to extract actionable business insights using advanced SQL techniques including CTEs, window functions, date functions, and RFM/Cohort analysis frameworks.

## 🗄️ Schema & ERD

The schema follows a **star schema** design with `orders` as the central fact table connected to dimension tables via foreign keys.

### Relationships
- `orders` → `customers` (customer_id)
- `order_items` → `orders` (order_id)
- `order_items` → `products` (product_id)
- `order_items` → `sellers` (seller_id)
- `order_payments` → `orders` (order_id)
- `order_reviews` → `orders` (order_id)
- `products` → `product_category_translation` (product_category_name)

## 📊 Key Analyses

### 1. Business Overview
- Total revenue, order volume and order status distribution
- Monthly revenue trend across 22 months
- Top 10 states by number of customers
- Used: `GROUP BY`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `COUNT DISTINCT`, `OVER()`

### 2. Delivery Performance
- Average delivery time by state
- On-time vs late delivery breakdown
- Top 10 worst states by late delivery percentage
- Used: `DATEDIFF`, `CASE WHEN`, `CTE`

### 3. Seller Performance
- Top 10 sellers by revenue with review scores
- Seller ranking using window functions
- Best seller per state using `PARTITION BY`
- Used: `RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `PARTITION BY`, chained CTEs

### 4. Customer RFM Segmentation
- Scored each customer on Recency, Frequency, Monetary value
- Segmented customers into: Champion, Loyal, New, At Risk, Lost, Potential Loyalist
- Used: `NTILE()`, 3 chained CTEs, business logic with `CASE WHEN`

### 5. Product Analysis
- Top 10 product categories by revenue
- Freight cost as % of product price by category
- Month-over-Month revenue growth for top 5 categories
- Used: `LAG()`, `COALESCE`, `PARTITION BY`, `HAVING`

### 6. Payment Analysis
- Revenue and transaction count by payment type
- Year-wise PIVOT of payment methods
- Order value bucketing with installment analysis
- Used: PIVOT with `CASE WHEN`, value bucketing, `OVER()`

### 7. Cohort Analysis
- Grouped customers by first purchase month
- Tracked retention rate for 6 months after first purchase
- Identified which cohorts had the highest retention
- Used: 5 chained CTEs, `PERIOD_DIFF`, `DATE_FORMAT`

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🚚 **AL (Alagoas) has the worst delivery performance** — nearly 1 in 4 orders (23.93%) delivered late, followed by MA (19.67%) and PI (15.97%)
- 💳 **Credit card dominates payments** — most used payment method across all years, with customers preferring installment payments for high-value orders
- 👥 **São Paulo drives the business** — SP has 40,302 customers, 3x more than RJ (12,384) and MG (11,259)
- 📦 **Bed & Bath is the top revenue category** — showed explosive MoM growth of 694% in early 2017
- 🔄 **Customer retention drops sharply after first purchase** — cohort analysis reveals Olist is heavily dependent on new customer acquisition
- ⭐ **Seller quality varies significantly** — top sellers by revenue don't always have the best review scores, showing a trade-off between volume and quality
